## TARDIS Protocals
As you may know there has been some protocals in the TARDIS now by acivating these special
controls these things may happen depending on the number

Protocol 1913 = Siege Mode (Nothing gets in, nothing gets out)
Protocol 3 = Cloak (No one can see your TARDIS)
Protocol 116 = Autopilot (Your TARDIS will automatically land upon takeoff)
Protocol 813 = Hail Mary (The TARDIS will depart and come to you when you are at low health)

Hope this helps!
